## Research Question
The research question we are addressing: How many images are sufficient to fully represent a material sample? 
The answer lies in determining whether the model, when trained with a specific number of input images, can accurately generate the complete material structure across all scales. If it can, then those input images are deemed "sufficient" to describe the material.

## Update: CycleGAN Model for Catalyst and Substrate Analysis

The primary goal of this model is to serve as a building block for a larger framework aimed at addressing research question. We plan to use understanding of this in downstream applications. 

The CycleGAN framework enables unpaired image-to-image translation, making it a powerful tool for understanding complex mappings between two domains, such as the structural and chemical properties of catalysts and substrates.

## Key Features
- **CycleGAN Implementation**: A deep learning architecture designed for translating images between two unpaired datasets.
- **Domain Mapping**: Understanding structural and chemical mappings between catalysts and substrates.
- **Larger Framework Integration**: Insights from this model will be used as input to a larger model addressing advanced research goals.

## Applications
- **Catalyst-Substrate Interaction**: Analyze and predict how various catalysts interact with different carbon substrates.
- **Materials Research**: Assist in designing and optimizing materials for chemical and industrial processes.
- **Deep Learning in Chemistry**: Leverage AI to gain insights into complex chemical systems.
